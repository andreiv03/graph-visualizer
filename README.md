# Graph Visualizer

A dynamic, interactive **graph visualizer** built with React, TypeScript, and Vis.js, designed to help you explore graph structures and algorithms like **DFS, Dijkstra, Prim, and Kruskal** in real-time. Featuring smooth UI interactions, a modular design, and animated algorithm steps — it’s perfect for learning, teaching, or tinkering with graph theory.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Graph Editor** – Add, move, delete, and connect nodes/edges.
- **Switch Between Directed/Undirected Graphs**
- **Algorithm Visualizations** – Step-by-step execution of:
  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Prim’s Algorithm
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm
  
- **Live Graph Traversal Feedback** – See path, visited nodes, and edge costs.
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly on all screen sizes.
- **Debounced UI Interactions** – Smooth toggling with built-in safety.

## ⚡ Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript** – Robust and scalable UI development.
- **Vis.js** – Powerful graph visualization library.
- **Framer Motion** – Elegant animations and transitions.
- **SCSS Modules** – Scoped styling for cleaner components.
- **Prettier** – Enforced code quality and consistency.
